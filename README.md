## Project Description:
- Used Heart Disease UCI dataset to analyse different parameters which often led to a Heart Attack
- Performed Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis of different parameters; used EDA and Advanced EDA (Pandas Profiling, Autoviz, Pandas Describe) to graphically represent the data and deduce certain key observations from it
- Created Correlation matrix on Categorical Data using Pearson and Spearman Method and also found the feature importance of various parameters which gave useful insights into the data
- Used LabelEncoder to encode the data 
- Performed Feature Selection on the Data using 5 different Feature Selection models - LinearSVC, Lasso, Chi-2, Regressive Elimination - Logistic Regression and VarianceThreshold
- For more accuracy, I considered a combination of 2 features as new features to increase the accuracy of the feature selection and prediction
- Used 4 ML models for prediction - Linear Regression, Random Forest classifier, Logistic Regression and XGBoost, did Hyperparameter tuning of the most accurate model to further increase accuracy
